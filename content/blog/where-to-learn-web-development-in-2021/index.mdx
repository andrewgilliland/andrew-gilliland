If it's 2021 and you are looking for some online resourses to learn web development, you are in luck. There's lots of great places to learn web development, and these are just a few of my suggestions.

## Egghead.io

[Egghead](https://egghead.io/) is an amazing premium course platform for learn everything web development. There are lessons and courses that go through a breadth of topics on various languages, frameworks, and libraries for web development. Course content comes from amazing instructors such as [Joel Hooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks), [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello), [Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf), [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds), [Laurie Barth](https://twitter.com/laurieontech), [Will Johnson](https://twitter.com/willjohnsonio), [Chris Biscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi), and too many other great developers to name. 

Not only can you come to Egghead to take courses but they also have Portfolio Project Clubs where instructors and students can meet to help each other grow. I have been a part of a couple Portfolio Project Clubs personally, and it is an amazing experience. Check it out [here](https://egghead.io/clubs/portfolio-project) if you want to learn more.
